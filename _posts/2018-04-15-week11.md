## Progress 

We have begun working on several issues that are promising!  We are on track to make our first real contributions soon!

I have also found errors in the in the documentation pages for zulip so will be reporting those errors as soon as I fix my development environment.  I have not reported the issues yet because you have a week to fix an issue once you claim it and I am having severe dev env problems right now. Ive burned 6 hours this week trying to get my dev env for zulip back up and working but for every action I take I just keep causing new problems. At this point Iâ€™ve considered wiping the hard drive clean on my macbook pro or trying to install the dev environment on my PC, but Im very unfamiliar with coding on PCs since I have never done it!
