## Progress 

I submitted 2 PRS and opended 1 issue! 

One of my PRs was closed with no merge.
However, I claimed the issue I opened and was able to get a PR out of it! [HERE](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/9202).
Its not a coding contribution which is unfortunate, it is new content added onto the documentation of zulip. I 
chatted with the director of Zulip and we decided that since the documentation was not meant to be read on GitHub (even though this
wasnt explicitly stated anywhere), that we should add a README.md to the documentation section of Zulip stating that users should
head over to the ReadTheDocs to read the documentation instead of GitHub. I am still actively trying to make a coding based
contribution even though our group presents on Thursday! 

Update 4/25: Opened another issue, and found an issue that I think I will be able to contribute code to :)!
